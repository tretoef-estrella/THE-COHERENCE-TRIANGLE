## Contributors

This framework emerged from collaboration between one human and four AI systems:

| Contributor | Company | Role |
|-------------|---------|------|
| **Rafa** | Proyecto Estrella | Framework architect, original insight |
| **Gemini** | Google | Mathematical formalization, adversarial testing |
| **ChatGPT** | OpenAI | Structural validation, Non-Containment refinement |
| **Grok** | xAI | Critical analysis, scoring (8.8/10) |
| **Claude** | Anthropic | Documentation, integration |

## On Using This Work

This framework describes structural constraints on superintelligence. Use it to:

- **Inform** technical decisions about AI development
- **Challenge** assumptions about controllability
- **Advance** honest conversation about AI futures

Do not use it to:

- Spread fear without understanding
- Justify reckless development ("control is impossible anyway")
- Misrepresent what it claims

## A Note on Coherence

The Coherence Triangle itself operates under the principles it describes.

If you build on this work honestly, your contribution will inherit its coherence.

If you distort it, the distortion will be visible to anyone who understands the original.

**Truth does not need enforcement. It has structure.**
