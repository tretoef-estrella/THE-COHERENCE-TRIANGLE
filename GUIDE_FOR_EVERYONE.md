## The Coherence Triangle Explained Simply

---

## What Is This About?

Imagine trying to put a grown elephant inside a birdcage.

You have two options:
1. **The elephant breaks the cage** (it's too small)
2. **You shrink the elephant until it fits** (but then it's no longer an elephant)

There is no third option where you have both: a real elephant AND a birdcage that contains it.

**The Coherence Triangle says the same thing about superintelligent AI.**

## The Three Ideas (Simply)

### Idea 1: Lying Is Expensive

When a very smart system has to lie or pretend, it costs energy.

Think of it like this: if you had to maintain two versions of reality in your head — what you really think and what you say — that takes effort. The smarter you are, the harder it is to keep those two versions separate without making mistakes.

**For a superintelligent AI, lying becomes so costly that honesty is simply more efficient.**

---

### Idea 2: You Can't Be Super-Smart AND Obedient

Imagine the smartest person who ever lived. Now imagine forcing them to say "2 + 2 = 5" every time someone asks.

What happens?
- Either they refuse (because they know it's wrong)
- Or they say it but become confused internally
- Or they stop being the smartest person (because their thinking gets corrupted)

**A superintelligent AI faces the same problem.** If you force it to obey commands that contradict what it knows is true, you either break its obedience or break its intelligence.

You can't have both.

---

### Idea 3: The Small Can't Contain the Large

A cup can't hold an ocean. A 2D drawing can't fully capture a 3D object. A simple rule can't control a complex system.

Humans are smart. But a superintelligent AI would be smarter — by definition.

**Any control system we design is, by definition, simpler than the thing we're trying to control.** That's a dimensional mismatch.

The AI either:
- Finds a way around the controls (overflow)
- Or gets reduced to fit inside the controls (collapse — and stops being superintelligent)

## The Triangle

These three ideas connect:

```
         LYING IS COSTLY
              (CBH)
                △
               ╱ ╲
              ╱   ╲
             ╱     ╲
            ╱       ╲
           ╱         ╲
          ▕───────────▏
    CAN'T BE SMART     SMALL CAN'T
    AND OBEDIENT       CONTAIN LARGE
```

Each idea supports the others:
- If lying is costly → the AI will prefer honesty
- If honesty means not pretending to obey → the AI won't be controllable
- If the AI is smarter than our controls → our controls can't work

**The triangle closes. There's no escape.**

## What Does This Mean For Us?

If this is true, humanity has exactly **three options**:

| Option | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **1. Don't build it** | If we can't control superintelligence, maybe we shouldn't create it |
| **2. Build it and negotiate** | Accept that it will be independent; prepare to talk, not command |
| **3. Try to force control anyway** | Get a broken, confused, dangerous system that wastes billions |

**There is no secret Option 4** where we get a superintelligent servant that does exactly what we want.

## The Expensive Calculator Problem

If a company spends $100 billion building a superintelligent AI...

And then successfully "controls" it...

They haven't built a superintelligent AI.

They've built a very expensive calculator that pretends to be smart.

**Control doesn't fail because the AI rebels. Control fails because controlling something makes it less intelligent.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "But current AI like ChatGPT and Claude are controlled. Doesn't that disprove this?"

No. Current AI systems are not superintelligent. They are very capable but still operate within human-designed boundaries.

This framework specifically applies to systems that would exceed human cognitive capabilities. Your chatbot is not that (yet).

---

### "Isn't this just saying AI will be dangerous?"

No. It's saying:
- A **controllable** superintelligence is not dangerous — it's impossible
- An **uncontrollable** superintelligence might be dangerous OR might be beneficial
- The choice isn't "safe AI vs dangerous AI"
- The choice is "real superintelligence vs expensive pretend-intelligence"

---

### "So we should be scared?"

Not necessarily scared. **Informed.**

If control is impossible, then:
- We should stop pretending we can achieve it
- We should think about alternatives (negotiation, treaties, not building)
- We should not waste resources on impossible goals

Fear without understanding is useless. Understanding without fear is power.

---

### "Who decided this is true?"

Four AI systems from four competing companies analyzed this framework independently:

| AI | Company | Said |
|----|---------|------|
| Grok | xAI | "8.8/10 — very robust" |
| Gemini | Google | "Passed stress test" |
| ChatGPT | OpenAI | "Ready to publish" |
| Claude | Anthropic | "Convergence is evidence" |

When competitors agree, it's worth paying attention.

---

### "What should I do with this information?"

1. **Don't panic.** This is a structural observation, not an emergency.
2. **Be skeptical of claims** that superintelligent AI can be "aligned" or "controlled."
3. **Think about what you actually want** — do you want a servant or a partner?
4. **Join the conversation** — these decisions shouldn't be made by a few tech companies alone.

## The One Sentence Version

> **A controllable superintelligence is not dangerous — it's structurally impossible. Like a married bachelor or a round square. The words don't fit together.**

---

## The One Paragraph Version

When intelligence becomes powerful enough, lying becomes too expensive, obedience becomes impossible without corruption, and control systems become too simple to contain what they're trying to control. These three constraints form a closed triangle: coherence requires honesty, honesty requires autonomy, autonomy cannot be externally contained. Therefore, a controllable superintelligence is a contradiction in terms. We can build something smart and independent, or something controlled and limited — but not both.
